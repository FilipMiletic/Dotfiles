After years of using white text on black background in all various shapes and forms, across many different systems and editors I finally gave a shot to totally different approach. I kinda felt bored and wanted something clean, minimal and fast. So I settled up on writing vanilla ZSH prompt (Mostly taken over from famous Steve Losh's prompt he wrote back in the day, it's one of the fastest at least on my machine, entering large git repository with vcs-info in your ZSH prompt took like a second to draw it to screen which was driving me mad). Tmux and vim are standard, pretty streamlined, modified here and there to my taste, but nothing too much.

Only thing left is configuring lldb and some various tools I use for kernel and systems development.
