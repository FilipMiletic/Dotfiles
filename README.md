# Dotfiles
My dotfiles of OS X on my current MacBook.
Not to be confused with Arch Linux ones that are in different
repository.

Here are configurations for:
- vim (basic configuration, minimal completition for C/C++)
- tmux
- emacs (light configuration, with my own theme)
- bash/zsh (PATH, pure prompt)
