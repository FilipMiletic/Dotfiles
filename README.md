# Dotfiles
My dotfiles of OS X on my current MacBook.
Not to be confused with Arch Linux ones that are in different
repository.

Here are configurations for:
- vim (basic configuration, minimal completition for C/C++/Python, evenutaly Go and JS)
- emacs (just in case, I missed it, and I am proud of my minimal under 100l config. /s)
- tmux
- bash/zsh (PATH, pure prompt)
